## Installation

(This UI is based on Transmission 2.84 running on Debian 8)

First, save the original UI with :

```sh
$ mv /usr/share/transmission/web/ /usr/share/transmission/web.old/
```

Then, download the new UI :

```sh
$ git https://github.com/Kalizo/Transmission-WFUI.git /usr/share/transmission/web/
```

Hum... Wait... That's all !
